NOTES









The -s Flag maybe the easiest way of upgrade an app agent as it collects current the app servers present on the host

  

$ ./install_appserver_agent.sh -s

$ ./install_appserver_agent.sh --debug -b <jvm_name> <controller_name>

  

JVM name is name of the hostname, the application, the tier name and the site number, like this

E.g. site1

CONTROLLER_NAME is the account name of the Appdynamics SAAS Server 

  

controller_name1     = Production controller

controller_name2 = Test/Dev controller

controller_name3    = h controller
